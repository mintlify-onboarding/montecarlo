Monte Carlo integrates directly into Slack so anomaly detections can be sent to any public channel in your workspace for quick triaging and collaboration. This guide explains how to receive Slack notifications from Monte Carlo.

### To Integrate a Slack Instance, you will:

1. Within Monte Carlo, access your Settings page and navigate to the **Integrations** section:

1. Select the **Add Slack** button:

1. Navigate through Slack permission granting process. You may need to wait on your Slack administrator to approve the request.

> If you are blocked by Slack on granting permissions, you will need to contact your Slack Admin to approve Monte Carlo as a trusted integration and grant the necessary permissions.

### To create Notifications to Private Channels

1. The Monte Carlo user must be invited to the Private channel. Type `/invite @Monte Carlo` in the channel to invite the Monte Carlo user.
2. The channel's ID **must be** manually entered in the **Private Channel ID** input. The integration will NOT work if you use the slack channel name instead. To get the channel ID, right-click on the channel's name and select **Open channel details** from the context menu. A dialog will open and display the channel ID in the dialog's footer.

### Triggering Notifications

Notifications are triggered automatically when any of the selected events are detected in your warehouse. If you'd like to send a notification to verify your Slack integration, you can click the `Send Test Notification` button in the Notifications settings.

### Incident Timeline

Slack messages sent in reply to incident notifications in public and private Slack channels will be displayed in the Incident Timeline section of the Monte Carlo Incident IQ page.

### Troubleshooting

**Why is my channel not appearing when configuring a new notification route?**

1. Ensure the channel you intend to use is a Public channel; Private channels will not show up in the list and must be entered manually (see above).
2. If the channel is new, make sure to refresh the channel list:

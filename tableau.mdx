### Tableau Version Support

Monte Carlo supports integrating with both Tableau Online and Tableau Server. Tableau Server requires version 2019.3 or later.

## Setup Overview

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Admin credentials required
> 
> To complete this guide, you will need Tableau admin credentials.

To review all steps necessary to integrate a BI tool with Monte Carlo, please see [here](/docs/bi-tools).

To connect Monte Carlo to Tableau, you must first create a Personal Access Token in Tableau. Once you have a Personal Access token, you can then add the integration in Monte Carlo.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

To create a PAT:

1. Go to "My Account Settings".
2. Click on the "Users" tab, then in the settings pane you can make a Personal Access Token.
3. Give your token a name and hit "Create new token". **Make sure you copy the token secret because it will only be shown to you once.**

_If you are integrating with multiple sites, please use a separate PAT for each_

### Add the Tableau Integration

In the "Settings" tab of your Monte Carlo workspace, please provide the following details to validate and complete the integration.

Pick the "Tableau" BI connection:

Provide the personal access token:

* **Token Name** and **Token Value**: Please provide the credentials that were created while making the token.

### Data Quality Warnings

From a Table-Asset or an Incident page, with Reports Affected, you can set a [Tableau Data Quality Warning](https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/dm%5Fdqw.htm) on any Tableau Data Source.

It will show up in Tableau like this:

And then edit the warning afterwards

The warnings will automatically clean-up and expire approximately 24 hours after you set or edit them.

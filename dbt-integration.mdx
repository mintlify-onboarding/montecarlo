### Overview

Monte Carlo's dbt integration imports manifest files and run result files in order to 

1. Map dbt models to tables in your data warehouse / data lake
2. Centralize your table metadata in one place by pulling in tags and descriptions from dbt
3. Show associated dbt model and test run results for each incident to help you troubleshoot.
4. [Generate incidents based on dbt model errors and test errors (New)](/docs/dbt-failures-are-monte-carlo-incidents)

The following guide explains how to set up the integration.

If you are using dbt Core, follow [this guide](dbt-core).

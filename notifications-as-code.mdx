### Overview

This guide explains how to use your Monitor as Code configuration files to setup Slack and Email notifications channels for custom monitors. Note: currently, only notifications from custom monitors are supported through Notifications as Code.

### Prerequisites

1. Follow the instructions on the [Monitors as Code: Prerequisites](/docs/monitors-as-code#prerequisites) section to configure your CLI
2. Setup your project file as described on [Monitors as code: Using code to define monitors](/docs/monitors-as-code#using-code-to-define-monitors)

### Defining notifications channels

In an existing monitor config file, or a new separate config file, add a `notifications` section to declare your channels. For each channel, indicate a `name` to uniquely identify the setting, the recipients, and a set of `audiences` for which the channel should be used.

Note that `audiences` inside of a `notifications` definition is referenced as `labels` in a monitor definition. `labels` and `audiences` are equivalent, but some cases still require the term `labels`.

Here's an example with all the currently supported channels, including a monitor definition leveraging one of the defined `audiences`:

YAML

`montecarlo:
  notifications:
    slack:
      - name: a-slack-notification
        channel: a-test-channel
        audiences: ['team-1', 'team-2']
    email:
      - name: a-email-notification
        emails: ['[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)', '[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)']
        audiences: ['team-1']
  field_health:
    - table: project:dataset.table_name
      timestamp_field: created
      labels: # monitors use the term labels, but they are equivalent to audiences
        - team-1
`

The `notifications` section can be declared on a file that already contains monitor definitions, or on a separate file. 

Notifications created through notifications as code will use the same namespace as the other monitors. You can get more information on namespaces [here](/docs/monitors-as-code#namespaces).

If the provided audiences do not exists, they will be created.

### Notifications configuration reference

`montecarlo:
  notifications:
    slack:
      - name: <string>           # required
        channel: <string>        # required
        is_private: <bool>       # optional - defaults to false, pass true to use a slack private channel 
        custom_message: <string> # optional - a message to show with the notification
        audiences:               # required - the audiences to match
          - <string>
    email:
      - name: <string>           # required
        emails:                  # required - one or more recipients email
          - <string> 
        custom_message: <string> # optional - a message to show with the notification
        audiences:               # required - the audiences to match
          - <string>
`

#### Slack

* `name`: Required value to uniquely identify the notification setting (to determine whether to create a new one or update an existing one for the namespace).
* `custom_message`: A custom message to show with the notification.
* `channel`: The slack channel name for public channels, or the Slack channel ID for private ones. The channel must exist.
* `is_private`: Set to `true` when sending notifications to a private Slack channel. The `channel` should include the channel ID instead of the name.
* `audiences`: List of audiences for the notification. Only incidents for monitors with these audiences will be forwarded. At least one audience must be provided.

#### Email

* `name`: Required value to uniquely identify the notification setting (to determine whether to create a new one or update an existing one for the namespace).
* `custom_message`: A custom message to show with the notification.
* `emails`: A list of emails to send the notifications to.
* `audiences`: List of audiences for the notification. Only incidents for monitors with these audiences will be forwarded. At least one audience must be provided.

title: "Partition Filtering for Monitors"
---

When Monte Carlo writes monitor queries to execute on your warehouse or lake, it uses the time-based partitions that are known based on metadata collection. Users do not need to specify partitions when creating most monitors, as they will be automatically inferred.

### Usage

When creating a Field Health or Dimension Tracking Monitor, under Advanced Options there is an option to **Enable auto-partition filtering**. It is on by default if a time-based partition is detected. If no time-based partition is detected on the table, this option will not be available.

### Integrations Supported

* [BigQuery](/docs/bigquery)
* [Databricks](/docs/overview-databricks)
* [Hive](/docs/hive-mysql) and [Glue](/docs/glue) Data Lakes

### Types of Queries Supported

Monte Carlo automatically detects and filters for date partitions for tables when writing queries for the following functionality:

* Field Health Monitors
* Dimension Tracking Monitors
* Root Cause Analysis Queries

For monitors where Monte Carlo does not write the SQL automatically (like [Custom Monitors - SQL Rules](/docs/creating-sql-rules)), this feature is not supported. It is available for Field Heath and Dimension Tracking Monitors. Monitors that use **All Records** instead of **Recent Data** are not supported.

### Formats of Partitions Supported

Partitions must be stored in one of the following formats in order to be inferred by Monte Carlo:

#### Single-Field Partitions

* Timestamp Fields: any native timestamp field in the listed supported integrations
* Date or String Fields - in the following formats (based on [standard C formatting](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-format-codes)):  
   * `%Y-%m-%d`  
   * `%Y-%m-%d`  
   * `%Y-%m-%d-%H`  
   * `%Y-%m`  
   * `%Y%m`  
   * `%Y%m%d`  
   * `%Y%m%d%H`  
   * `'%Y%m%d%H%M%S`  
   * `%Y%m%d%H%M%S`  
   * `%Y%m%d%H%M%S000`  
   * `%YW%W`

#### Multiple-Field Partitions

If your partitions are separated into multiple String or Numeric fields, they must meet both the naming convention and formats below. 

##### Field Naming Convention

* Year: `year`, `yr`, `y`
* Month: `month`, `m`
* Week: `??`
* Day: `day`, `d`
* Hour (optional): `hour`, `hr`, `h`

##### Field Supported Formats:

* Year: `%Y`
* Month: `%m`
* Week: `%W`
* Day: `%d`
* Hour: `%H`

### Supported Examples

* BigQuery table partition of `_PARTITIONTIME` or `_PARTITIONDATE`
* Databricks table partitioned by `dt` field in `%Y-%m-%d` format AND `hr` field in `%H` format

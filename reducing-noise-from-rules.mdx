title: "Reducing noise from rules"
---

When the conditions of a Freshness Rule, Volume Rule, Field Quality Rule, or SQL Rule are breached, it creates an Incident. This Incident will trigger a notification, based on configurations in [Settings > Notifications](https://getmontecarlo.com/settings/notifications).

Some rules may remain in a â€˜breachedâ€™ state for an extended period of time. This can result in repetitive notifications, especially if the rule runs on a frequent schedule. This can cause undesirable alert fatigue.

Monte Carlo offers ways to minimize repetitive notifications during these scenarios. Options are made available in the _Define schedule_ section of Freshness, Volume, Field Quality, or SQL Rule creation. See here:

### For SQL Rules and Field Quality Rules

Select 1 from the following set of options:

While the threshold stays violated, send a notification and then:

* **Reduce noise**: send another notification every \[ X \] runs of the rule
* **Reduce noise**: send another notification only if the value or count of breached rows changes
* Notify every time

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> **Note**: In SQL Rules, these options are only available when an _Absolute_ threshold is selected. They are not available for rules with _Automatic_ or _Relative_ thresholds, as those are less prone to repetitive notifications.

Here is an example of how those options would play out over the course of 25 runs of a hypothetical SQL Rule whose breach condition is to notify if count is > 0\. In this scenario, Option 1 is set to send another notification every **4** consecutive breached runs.

### For Freshness Rules and Volume Rules

Select 1 from the following set of options:

While the threshold stays violated, send a notification and then:

* **Reduce noise**: send another notification every \[ X \] runs of the rule
* **Reduce noise**: donâ€™t send another notification
* Notify every time

Here is an example of how those options would play out over the course of 25 runs of a hypothetical Freshness Rule or Volume Rule. In this scenario, Option 1 is set to send another notification every **4** consecutive breached runs.

### In Monitors as Code

The configuration options for Reduce Noise are called `event_rollup_count` and `event_rollup_until_changed`. Visit the [Monitors as Code](/docs/monitors-as-code) documentation for full details.

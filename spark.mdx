To connect Monte Carlo to a Spark cluster for health queries, follow these steps:

1. Create a Spark cluster for Monte Carlo. Alternatively, you may use an existing cluster that you already have in your environment. Ensure that auto-termination is off.
2. Ensure that the Spark Thrift Server is enabled. Different distributions handle this server differently, for example, it is enabled by default on Databricks but needs to be enabled explicitly on EMR.
3. Ensure that Monte Carlo's data collector has [network connectivity](/docs/network-connectivity) to the cluster (VPC peering might be required).
4. Create a service account on your Spark cluster (if necessary).
5. Provide service account credentials to Monte Carlo as described below.

> * A more convenient way to add a connection to an all-purpose cluster is through the [ integrations](https://getmontecarlo.com/settings/integrations) wizard in the Monte Carlo application.
> * The minimum supported Databricks version is 7.x.

### Providing account credentials to Monte Carlo

You will provide connection details for Spark using Monte Carlo's CLI:

1. Please follow [this guide](/docs/using-the-cli) to install and configure the CLI.
2. Monte Carlo supports three types of connections: binary, HTTP and Databricks. Please use the command `montecarlo integrations [add-spark-binary-mode | add-spark-http-mode | add-spark-databricks]` to set up Spark connectivity. For reference, see help for the commands below.

Freshness Rules can be used to define explicit thresholds around how often a table should receive updates.

When a Freshness Rule monitor is set up, Monte Carlo periodically collects metadata of the target table to determine if the table has not received an expected freshness update.

### Configure a Freshness Monitor

To configure a Freshness Monitor you simply need to select one or more tables and select the lookback range within which you expect the table(s) to receive an update.

### Define Schedule and Lookback range

For Freshness Rules to work well, it's critical to closely review the run schedule and lookback range.

We recommend keeping the following pointers in mind:

* For tables that receive regular updates, it's best to match the run schedule (ex. run every 6 hours looking back 6 hours)
* For tables that receive scheduled updates, ensure that the schedule and lookback period match the defined pattern (ex. run at 9am UTC every day looking back 2 hours) - this is often done to check that a scheduled run completed successfully

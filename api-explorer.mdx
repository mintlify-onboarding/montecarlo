Monte Carlo's **API Explorer** is an in-browser tool powered by [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql) that can be used to quickly get started experimenting or testing any Monte Carlo APIs. These are the same APIs that power Monte Carlo's web-based application, CLI, Airflow provider, and SDK.

Head over to [https://getmontecarlo.com/graphiql](https://getmontecarlo.com/graphiql) or open up the Dashboard tab to give it a try.

### Basic usage

The API Explorer lets you run any queries and mutations with syntax highlighting, auto-completion, error highlighting, and a persisted local history. You can find a full API reference guide [here](https://apidocs.getmontecarlo.com/) or in the explorer.

title: "Interacting with Incidents"
---

Discover and troubleshoot anomalous events happening in the data assets within your data ecosystem from the Incidents pages in Monte Carlo.

### Exploring the Incidents Feed

Upon navigation to Incidents, you see a feed of all incidents, past and ongoing. You can see some filters at the top to filter the incidents displayed in the feed.

![Incidents feed with incident status dropdown selected](/images/a41d354-image.png)

Incidents feed with incident status dropdown selected

Each card on this page is a summary of the incident with a few, quick-access incident management tools that allow you to -

* Assign an Owner to the incident
* Classify severity
* Manage Investigation Status
* Mute alerts on an asset
* Snooze a monitor

You can also see a helpful **Incident Status Tracker** which gives you insight into the status of incidents for the current week. This can be helpful in tracking internal SLA's.

#### Summary

The Summary menu is the landing page of Incident IQ and contains a quick view of the incident details.

Within the top Summary section of the Summary menu, you can see the high-level details about the incident. 

![Summary section on Incident IQ](/images/9f34e5b-image.png)

Summary section on Incident IQ

Here, the following information is provided:

* **Tables** \- a list of tables involved in the incident. Clicking on a table in this list will take you to the Catalog page for that table.
* **Owner** \- the person responsible for investigating the incident. Manage ownership of the incident by clicking the edit icon, selecting an owner, and clicking Save.
* **Severity** \- the severity of the incident as indicated by No Severity or SEV-0:4\. Typically, SEV-0 indicates highest level of impact, and SEV-4 indicates least impactful. Manage severity of the incident by clicking the edit icon, selecting a severity, and clicking Save.
* **Notification Channels** \- a list of [Notification Channels](/docs/how-to-create-a-notification-in-monte-carlo) which were alerted to this incident. Clicking on a Slack Notification Channel will take you to that channel in your Slack instance.
* **Impact Radius** \- a visualization of the impact of the incident as it relates to Users/Queries/Reports which are dependent on the affected table(s), based on data in Query logs for the table. Clicking on the tiles within this visualization will open a drawer in the UI where you can see the Users/Queries/Reports potentially affected by the incident.

Below the top Summary section is a graph which provides visual insight into why the incident was raised. 

![Graph on Summary menu of Incident IQ](/images/799a321-image.png)

Graph on Summary menu of Incident IQ

In this example, the incident originated from an [automated (out of the box) monitor](/docs/automated-monitoring) which tracks patterns in Volume change -

* The blue line on the graph represents the change in Volume over the previous week.
* The section highlighted in red indicates a deviation from the normal pattern.

In this case, the deviation is a halt in Volume changes. In other words, the table has not changed in size as expected based on historical trends.

#### Table Lineage

The Table Lineage menu of Incident IQ provides insight into tables upstream and downstream of the affected table. 

From here you can trace data upstream, to investigate root cause...

![Table Lineage menu in Incident IQ showing Upstream nodes](/images/1465d21-image.png)

... and downstream, to understand the impact of the incident.

![Table Lineage menu in Incident IQ showing Downstream nodes](/images/044dc22-image.png)

Table Lineage menu in Incident IQ showing Downstream nodes

In the example, some nodes are filled in yellow indicating that an Incident exists on that node.

Hovering over the node provides some detail about the Incident related to that node as well as a link to the Incident.

![Hovering over the upstream node provides insight into the Incident related to that node as well as a link to that Incident](/images/477445e-image.png)

### Frequently Asked Questions

**We see flags on some of our incidents that reference correlation or query insights, what is this?**

Correlation and query insights represent automated findings that Monte Carlo produced to facilitate the discovery of the root cause of a particular data incident. [Click here to learn more about this great feature](/docs/dbt-integration).

**The dbt menu item was not mentioned here, what is that?**

If you have a dbt integration set up, you can access information about the dbt model related to the affected table within the dbt menu. [Click here to learn more about our dbt integration](/docs/dbt-integration).

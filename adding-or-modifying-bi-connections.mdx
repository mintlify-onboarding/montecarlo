title: "Adding or Modifying BI Connections"
---

If you need to add another BI connection or modify an existing connection, you can now do so using the UI! Currently, **Monte Carlo supports both modifying existing Looker connections as well as adding any number of additional Looker APIs or LookML repos. Monte Carlo also supports editing Tableau connections as well as adding additional Tableau connections if you have multiple Tableau Servers or Tableau Sites you would like Monte Carlo to monitor.** 

### Adding a New Connection

In the top navigation bar, click on your "Settings" tab, and then click on the "Integrations" tab in the left hand side bar. On this page, you should see all your existing BI and warehouse connections:

Click on the blue "+" icon:

You will now have the option to pick which connection you want to add:

When you click on your option, you will see placeholder values prepopulated to display what formatting each option expects. Add your connection details, and click "CONNECT":

You will see a module pop up testing the connection. On successful connection, the module will show a green check mark saying the connection was successful; if there was an error connecting using the details provided, the error will surface for further debugging.

### Editing an Existing Connection

Similar to the steps above, in the top navigation bar, click on your "Settings" tab, and then click on the "Integrations" tab in the left hand side bar. On this page, you should see all your existing BI and warehouse connections:

For any existing connections that are modifiable, you should see the option to edit by the pencil icon in the upper right hand corner of the card:

If you click on the pencil, you will be taken to a screen that is prepopulated with your existing connection details (minus the sensitive information, like passwords and keys). You can then modify any of your connection details:

Click "CONNECT" when finished. You will see a module pop up testing the connection. On successful connection, the module will show a green check mark saying the connection was successful; if there was an error connecting using the details provided, the error will surface for further debugging.

This guide explains how to create a read-only service account for Monte Carlo on BigQuery.

To review all steps necessary to integrate a data warehouse with Monte Carlo, please see [here](/docs/data-warehouses).

### Creating a service account for a single BigQuery project

First, create a role for Monte Carlo's service account:

1. Under _IAM & Admin_, go to the _Roles_ section in your Google Cloud Platform console.
2. Select the project to which your BigQuery warehouse belongs using the combo box on the top left of your dashboard.
3. Click the _Create Role_ button at the top of the tab.
4. Give the new role a name. We recommend "Data Reliability Monitor".
5. Change the Role launch stage to "General Availability".
6. Click _Add Permissions_ and add the permissions specified below to the role. To make the process faster, consider filtering the permission list by the role _BigQuery Admin_.

Now, create a service account:

1. Under _IAM & Admin_, go to the _Service Accounts_ section in your Google Cloud Platform console.
2. Click the _Create Service Account_ button at the top of the tab.
3. Give the account a name and continue. We recommend naming the account "monte-carlo".
4. Assign the role you previously created to the service account and continue.
5. Click the _Create Key_ button, select JSON as the type and click _Create_. A JSON file will download â€“ please keep it safe as it grants access to your BigQuery data.
6. Click _Done_ to complete the creation of Monte Carlo's service account.

Finally, upload the JSON file you downloaded into Monte Carlo's onboarding wizard to finalize the integration.

### Permissions Monte Carlo requires

Text

`bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.datasets.getIamPolicy
bigquery.jobs.get
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.jobs.listAll
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
storage.buckets.list
storage.buckets.get
storage.objects.list
storage.objects.get
resourcemanager.projects.get
`

### Monitoring multiple projects using Monte Carlo

Allowing Monte Carlo's service account to access multiple projects can help with the following use cases:

* Tracking multiple datasets spread across more than one BigQuery project.
* Tracking query logs and lineage generated by users associated with more than one project.

To add an additional project to Monte Carlo's service role:

1. Select the project using the combo box on the top left of the Google Cloud Platform console.
2. Create a role that grants BigQuery access with the appropriate permissions following the instructions [above](/docs/bigquery#creating-a-service-account-for-a-single-bigquery-project). Optionally, you may use the following command in your terminal to copy the role over from another project (this is much quicker!):

Shell

`gcloud iam roles copy
`

1. Under _Access_, go to the _IAM_ section in your Google Cloud Platform console.
2. Click the _Add_ button, provide Monte Carlo's service account email address and click _Save_.

You may add any number of projects to Monte Carlo's service account.

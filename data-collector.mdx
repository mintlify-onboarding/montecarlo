Monte Carlo uses a data collector to connect to data warehouses, data lakes and BI tools in order to extract metadata, logs and statistics. The data collector is deployed in Monte Carlo's secure AWS environment across our Fortune 500 clients to ensure a seamless deployment process and best-in-class customer support. This section outlines the architecture and deployment options of the data collector. 

### Architecture

The data collector architecture is optimized as seen below to ensure maximum security as we interact with your data.

Architecture

### Deployment Options

#### SaaS Option

Monte Carlo is a SaaS platform. We will take on deployment and management of the data collector. This makes it easier for us to manage the infrastructure in cases like upgrading, operationally monitor the collector's infrastructure, and provide better debugging support.

When Monte Carlo is hosting the data collector, the major configuration required is [network connectivity](/docs/network-connectivity), which your MC representative will help you through.

#### Hybrid Option

Though the SaaS deployment option is strongly recommended, this is optional and not required. If you have more stringent security/compliance requirements, deploying the collector in your AWS environment is a viable option. Please see our [Hybrid Solution documentation](/docs/hybrid-solution) for more details regarding this route.

### Data Collections

See below for information regarding where Monte Carlo collects data from per integration, and at what interval:

title: "Monte Carlo 101 | Platform Overview"
---

**What you'll learn** 🤓: The first set of videos is a high level introduction to Data Observability, where Monte Carlo sits in your Data Stack and an introduction to the key components of the tool; Domains, Assets, Incidents and Lineage. This section will give you the ability to understand why an incident has happened and the tools required to run root cause analysis on solving it. 

**Who will benefit** 🙋‍♂️: All users (technical and non-technical) who will interact with incidents, either in Monte Carlo or in the downstream notification tools will find value in this section.

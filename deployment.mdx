title: "Deploying the Collector"
---

To deploy the data collector in your AWS environment, you will:

1. [Obtain your account's data collector template](/docs/deployment#obtaining-your-cloudformation-template) by signing up to Monte Carlo.
2. [Create the data collector CloudFormation stack](/docs/deployment#creating-the-collectors-stack-in-your-aws-account) in your AWS account.

If you do not wish to host the data collector in your environment, please contact your representative to deploy it in Monte Carlo's environment.

### Obtaining your CloudFormation template

1. Please create your Monte Carlo account by visiting the [sign up page](https://getmontecarlo.com/signup). If someone else on your team has already created an account, please reach out to them to obtain the template.
2. Follow the onboarding steps to reach the "Install data collector" step, where you will have a link to your account's CloudFormation template. Please note: the link is specific to your account and cannot be shared across accounts.
3. You can select the desired AWS region you want the Data Collector hosted in by using the combo-box in the upper right corner.

### Creating the collector's stack in your AWS account

1. Please make sure you are signed in to the AWS console for the account which will host the data collector.
2. Copy the link provided by Monte Carlo and paste it in your browser. In the page that opens, please name the CloudFormation stack, configure [advanced options](/docs/deployment#advanced-options) if necessary and click "Create Stack" to deploy it.

Creating the data collector stack

### Advanced options

The data collector defaults to the most common setup, and most customers will keep the pre-populated default parameter settings when deploying its stack.

The following configurations are available for customized setups:

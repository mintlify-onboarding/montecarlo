title: "Failure Notifications"
---

There are a variety of reasons a custom monitor may fail to run, such as a query time-out, insufficient permissions, or a referenced table being deleted.

When creating a custom monitor, you have the option to be proactively notified when that monitor fails. To ensure that Failure Notifications for a monitor are on, go to the **Send Notifications** section of the monitor creation or edit page, and be sure the toggle is set to the right (purple).

If the monitor fails while this option is enabled, a failure notification will be sent to same destinations that an Incident notification would be sent to.

Additional details:

* In September, 2023, the default setting for Failure Notifications for newly created monitors was changed from **off** to **on**  
   * All monitors created through the Monte Carlo UI after September 21, 2023 have, by default, Failure Notifications set to **on**.  
   * All monitors created through Monitors as Code after September 28, 2023 have, by default, Failure Notifications set to **on** unless it was specified off in the config.

* Failure notifications are only sent for failures, but not for any types of [misconfigurations](/docs/misconfigured-monitors).

The following examples are general queries related to users, insights, assets and more.

Please note that the sample queries below only show a subset of the fields available for brevity. You can use introspection to see all available fields.

### User Information

Get a user and their account information:

Sample QuerySample Response

`query getUser {
  getUser {
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    createdOn
    role
    account {
      uuid
    }
  }
}
`

`{
  "data": {
    "getUser": {
      "email": "[[emailÂ protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection)",
      "firstName": "Katie",
      "lastName": "Noonan",
      "createdOn": "2021-05-10T00:00:00Z",
      "role": "OWNER"
      "account": {
        "uuid": "<my_account_uuid>"
      }
    }
  }
}
`

### Search for Assets

Assets (tables, views, reports, fields, etc.) can be searched for using `search`.

These results can be paginated through and filtered by type too.

Sample QuerySample Response

`query search {
  search(query: "foo", limit: 2) {
    totalHits
    offset
    results {
      mcon
      displayName
      objectType
    }
  }
}
`

`{
  "data": {
    "search": {
      "totalHits": 10,
      "offset": 2,
      "results": [
        {
          "mcon": "dummy_table_id_1",
          "displayName": "foo:bar.baz",
          "objectType": "table"
        },
        {
          "mcon": "dummy_table_id_2",
          "displayName": "foo:bar.qux",
          "objectType": "table"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
`

### Download Insights Reports

Insights reports can be exported using the **getReportUrl** function and querying the resulting URL endpoint. The parameters correspond to reports as follows:

_Key Assets_  
insightName: key\_assets  
reportName: key\_assets.csv

_Custom Monitors_  
insightName: monitors  
reportName: monitors.csv

_Cleanup Suggestions_  
insightName: cleanup\_suggestions  
reportName: cleanup\_suggestions.csv

_Events_  
insightName: events  
reportName: events.csv

_Table Read/Write Activity_  
insightName: table\_read\_write\_stats  
reportName: table\_read\_write\_stats.csv

Sample QuerySample Response

`query{
  getReportUrl(
    insightName: insight_name_here
    reportName: report_name_here
  ){
    url
  }
}
`

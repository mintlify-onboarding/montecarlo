**FULL\_TABLE\_ID** : A concatenation of project, dataset and table name 

**IMPORTANCE\_SCORE** : A score from 0-1 expressed as a decimal. See how it is calculate below.

**IS\_MUTED**: True if the table is muted; meaning you will not receive notifications with alerts. False otherwise.  
  
**VOLUME\_CHANGE\_IS\_ACTIVE**: True if the monitor is active, False if it is not active.  
  
**VOLUME\_CHANGE\_INACTIVE\_SINCE**: The date that the monitor became inactive, 'null' where the monitor is active.  
  
**UNCHANGED\_SIZE\_IS\_ACTIVE**: True if the monitor is active, False if it is not active.

**UNCHANGED\_SIZE\_INACTIVE\_SINCE**: The date that the monitor became inactive, 'null' where the monitor is active.

**FRESHNESS\_ACTIVE**: True if the monitor is active, False if it is not active.

**FRESHNESS\_INACTIVE\_SINCE**: The date that the monitor became inactive, 'null' where the monitor is active.

**VOLUME\_SLO**: True if there is a custom Volume SLO monitor on the table, False otherwise. 

**FRESHNESS\_SLO**: True if there is a custom Freshness SLO monitor on the table, False otherwise.

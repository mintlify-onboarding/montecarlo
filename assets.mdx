#### Overview

Monte Carlo's Assets provides users with a single pane of glass to see all of the data assets that are connected to your Monte Carlo instance. A data asset can be an external table, a table or a view.

When Monte Carlo is connected to your data sources, metadata about your data assets is collected from those sources. This metadata, along with insights derived by the Monte Carlo analytics engine, is made available in various visual formats within the Assets page of a data asset.

_Please note: Assets is a Monte Carlo feature that was formerly named Catalog_

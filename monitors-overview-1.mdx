### Monitor Types

At Monte Carlo, we have:
<Card title="Out of the box ML Monitors" icon="box-open" iconType="duotone">
  (Freshness, Volume and Schema Changes) which run hourly and check the metadata table for all tables.
</Card>
<Card title="Custom ML Monitors " icon="gauge" iconType="duotone">
  (Field Health, Dimension Tracking and JSON Schema) which run on a user defined schedule and use ML to catch anomalous data changes within fields.
</Card>
<Card title="Custom Rules Based Monitors" icon="gavel" iconType="duotone">
  (SQL, Field Quality, Referential Integrity and Comparison Rules which run on a user defined schedule and do not use Machine Learning. These are manual checks which can be used to validate ways in which you know
</Card>

This next section introduces these monitors at a high level and walks you through how to build each of the monitors for your own practical use case.

### Monitors Best Practices

When building out monitors, answer the following questions to ensure you're building monitors that will help you accomplish your business objectives. 

* **Timing**: When should monitors run? When do I need to be alerted?
* **Frequency**: How often should monitors run? How often does the table update?
* **Coverage**: What needs to be monitored? Do I need to monitor all fields? Should I add filters?
* **Cost**: What impact will this monitor have on warehouse sql query costs or performance?
* **Alerting**: Who gets notified if the monitor catches an anomaly?
* **Warehouse size**: What size warehouse is required for the query to run in under 15 minutes?
* **Domain Coverage**: What percent of key assets within a domain have a monitor?
* **Application**: What monitor should be applied depending on the type of table?
* **Governance**: How will we standardize naming conventions for monitors?

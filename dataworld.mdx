With the integration between data.world and Monte Carlo, data consumers have clear visibility into the current health and level of coverage of their data. Recent incidents are surfaced directly within data.world, so consumers can have an up-to-date insight into the usability of a particular table. This drives trust, transparency, and confidence. 

Documentation for how to integrate with data.world is available through their documentation site:

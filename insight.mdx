### Field Defintions

**FULL\_TABLE\_ID** : A concatenation of project, dataset and table name 

**PROJECT\_NAME** : As defined externally

**DATASET\_NAME** : As defined externally(e.g. a schema in snowflake) 

**TABLE\_NAME**: As defined externally

**TABLE\_TYPE** : Field values: table, view, external, wildcard\_table 

**FIELD\_TO\_CLEANUP** : A list of fields that can be removed

**FIELD\_TO\_KEEP** : A list of fields that should be kept

**PERCENT\_REMOVABLE** : The % of fields in the table that can be deleted, the insight is sorted by this.

**TABLE\_IMPORTANCE\_SCORE** : The table importance score, the insight is sorted by this

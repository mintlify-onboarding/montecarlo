Monte Carlo allows developers to programmatically manage its data observability service using:

1. **API**: Monte Carlo exposes a rich GraphQL API. This is the same API that powers Monte Carlo's web-based application and therefore offers a broad range of capabilities.
2. **SDK**: Developers can also use the python SDK to more conveniently access all of Monte Carloâ€™s APIs.
3. **CLI**: To simplify certain onboarding and integration operations, developers can install and use command line interface (CLI).
4. **Providers**: To use/include Monte Carlo in orchestration tools.  
For instance, using [Circuit breakers](/docs/circuit-breakers) to stop pipelines when data does not meet a set of quality or integrity thresholds.
5. **Monitors as code (IaC + CLI)**: To deploy monitors as part of a CI/CD process.

An API key is required to authenticate calls. Consider also checking out the [API Explorer](/docs/api-explorer) to get started.

### Creating an API key

To create an API key, please visit the [API settings page](https://getmontecarlo.com/settings/api) on your Monte Carlo dashboard and click _Create Key_. Monte Carlo supports both personal and account-level keys, although only users with the Account Owner role can create account-level keys.

Creating an API key on the Settings page

In addition, you can create an API key from Monte Carlo's [onboarding wizard](https://getmontecarlo.com/get-token).

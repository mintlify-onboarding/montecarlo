## Platform Architecture

Monte Carlo operates as a software-as-a-service with options to extend components of the platform into the customer environment for security and compliance requirements.

### Platform Components

#### Cloud Service

Monte Carlo operates a cloud service to support the user interface, data monitoring system, reliability dashboards, and notification routing.

#### Agent

An isolated, customer-dedicated Agent that is used to connect to customer resources for monitoring.

#### Object Storage

Object storage bucket for a small sample of individual values or data records from the customer environment that are associated with a data reliability incident detected by Monte Carlo.

## Deployment Options Overview

Monte Carlo offers three different deployment models that vary based on where components of the architecture are deployed. Generally, for best-in-class support and minimal-to-no overhead, we recommend a **Cloud** or **Cloud with Customer-hosted Object Storage**.

### Cloud Deployment

Monte Carlo operates completely as a software-as-a-service (SaaS). An isolated, customer-dedicated Agent and Object Storage are deployed in Monte Carlo's cloud to connect to customer resources.

### Cloud with Customer-hosted Object Storage Deployment

Monte Carlo operates completely as a software-as-a-service (SaaS), _with the exception of the Object Storage being hosted by the customer_. An isolated, customer-dedicated Agent is deployed in Monte Carlo's cloud to connect to customer resources. 

This deployment model allows customers to never store record-level data with Monte Carlo while minimizing hosting maintenance and overhead.

Available for AWS and Google Cloud.

### Customer-hosted Agent & Object Storage Deployment

The Monte Carlo Agent and Object Storage are deployed in the customer environment. 

This deployment model allows the most the most control but requires the most maintenance and hosting for customers.

Available for AWS today and Google Cloud is coming soon.

## Deployment Options Comparison

The following matrix compares what each deployment model means from an infrastructure (i.e. the resources you host), network (i.e. how to establish reachability between Monte Carlo and an integration), object storage (i.e. where troubleshooting and temporary data is stored) and maintenance perspective (e.g. any required upgrades or management).

Note that Metadata, Metrics, Query logs, and Aggregated / anonymized statistics are always stored in Monte Carlo's Cloud. Troubleshooting data refers to a small sample of individual values or data records to make it easier for you to investigate, root cause, and resolve an incident or data issue. You can always opt out of storing any troubleshooting data, per integration, regardless of the option you select.

#### Overview

Monte Carlo incidents are data anomalies that have occurred in your data ecosystem. These anomalies can be triggered either by our automated monitoring or custom monitoring that you can enable. Find out more about the types of monitoring we offer in the [Monitors section of Monte Carlo University](/docs/monitors-1).

Monte Carlo's Incidents section is your command center for understanding what is happening in your data ecosystem as well as providing tools to perform root cause analysis and manage the incident to resolution.

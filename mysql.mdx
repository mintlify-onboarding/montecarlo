Integrating Monte Carlo with MySQL allows you to monitor your data assets through [custom SQL monitors](/docs/creating-sql-rules), which can be created in either the [UI wizard](https://getmontecarlo.com/monitors/create/sql-rule) and/or programmatically via [monitors as code](/docs/monitors-as-code) (API/SDK too). These monitors can be used to generate [notifications](/docs/slack) (incidents) to relevant stakeholders and [circuit break](/docs/circuit-breakers) pipelines.

## Integration Setup

To connect Monte Carlo to a MySQL database, follow these steps:

1. [Enable network connectivity](/docs/mysql#1-enable-network-connectivity) between the database and Monte Carlo's data collector.
2. [Create a read-only service account](/docs/mysql#2-create-a-read-only-service-account) with the appropriate permissions on your database.
3. [Provide service account credentials](/docs/mysql#3-provide-service-account-credentials-to-monte-carlo) to Monte Carlo (requires [Using the CLI](/docs/using-the-cli)).

### 1\. Enable network connectivity

Follow the [Network Connectivity](/docs/aws-networking-tips) guide to IP Allowlist or VPC peer to provide access to MySQL.

### 2\. Create a read-only service account

> ðŸ“˜
> 
> Prerequisites
> 
> To create a service account, you will need admin credentials to your MySQL database.

Please run the SQL snippet below on your MySQL database to create a read-only service account for Monte Carlo

SQL

`CREATE USER 'montecarlo' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';

/* 
Grant access to all tables and views. Repeat for all relevant schemas (databases).
Select permissions are necessary to create custom SQL monitors. 
*/
GRANT SELECT, SHOW VIEW ON <SCHEMA>.* TO 'montecarlo';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
`

### 3\. Provide service account credentials to Monte Carlo

1. Please follow [this](/docs/using-the-cli) guide to install and configure the CLI.
2. Please use the command `montecarlo integrations add-mysql` to connect. For reference, see help [here](https://clidocs.getmontecarlo.com/index.html#montecarlo-integrations-add-mysql).

Example

`montecarlo integrations add-mysql \
	--name artemis-dev \
	--host example.cluster.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com \
	--user montecarlo \
	--password -1
`

To connect Monte Carlo to a Presto cluster to run data health SQL queries, follow these steps:

1. Create a Presto cluster for Monte Carlo's data health queries using AWS EMR. Alternatively, you may use an existing cluster that you already have in your environment.
2. Ensure that Monte Carlo's data collector has [network connectivity](/docs/network-connectivity) to the cluster (VPC peering is required in most cases).
3. Create a read-only service account on Presto if necessary.
4. Provide service account credentials to Monte Carlo.

### Creating a service account on Presto

Monte Carlo supports basic authentication or custom certificates for Presto connections. Please create a read-only user for Monte Carlo, or obtain a certificate file that enables authentication to Presto.

### Providing account credentials to Monte Carlo

You will provide connection details for Presto using Monte Carlo's CLI: 

1. Please follow [this guide](/docs/using-the-cli) to install and configure the CLI.
2. Please use the command `montecarlo integrations add-presto` to set up Presto connectivity. For reference, see help for this command below:

Shell

`$ montecarlo integrations add-presto --help

### Welcome to Monte Carlo University!

These guides range from basic concepts like navigating the Monte Carlo UI, to more advanced tutorials like setting up Monitors as Code. They are perfect for users trying to get familiar with the platform, or for users who are ready for an introduction into some of the more advanced concepts.

### Monte Carlo University in a nutshell

MC University is a self-guided resource to learn about the Monte Carlo platform. We've broken the sessions into three major buckets: MC 101, 102, and 103, which contain roughly 40 bitesized chapters total. 

#### What to expect:

**MC 101 | Platform Overview** 

* **What**: A high level introduction to Data Observability, where Monte Carlo sits in your Data Stack and an introduction to the key components of the tool; Domains, Assets, Incidents and Lineage. You'll leave with the ability to understand why an incident has happened and the tools required to run root cause analysis on solving it.
* **Who**: All users welcome (technical and non-technical)! Anyone who will interact with incidents, either in Monte Carlo or in the downstream notification tools should leverage the MC 101 course.

**MC 102 | Notification and Monitors**

* **What**: All things Notifications and Monitors. This section will help you to understand how the Monte Carlo monitors work, how to add new Custom Monitors and how to route notifications to the right channels.
* **Who**: Account Owners, Domain Managers, Editors, and anyone who will be hands-on in building out new use cases within Monte Carlo will get the most value from this section.

**MC 103 | Automation**

* **What**: Dive deep into API, SDK, Monitors as Code, using regex to filter out Lineage and other practical automated approaches to using the tool.
* **Who**: Technical owners of the tool who want to incorporate monitoring and extrapolate insights as part of your core CICD pipeline
